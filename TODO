o Rule: Symbol keys are variables, String keys are directories

o Use Nodes everywhere -> makes a lot of stuff much easier

o Check "dir: file" vs. "dir:\n  - file"

o Allow shell escapes to return arrays and hashes

o Allow directories within directories:
    dir/
      - file
      - subdir/
        - element # Oops: Illegal YAML syntax

o What happens if directory declarations maps to the same:
  dir1: dir
  dir2: dir
  $dir1:
    - file
  $dir2:
    - file

o Use same naming everywhere: field vs. value, name vs. path etc.
  - "fields" are variables that also are RPM fields
  - "variables" are QRPM variables

o Better references to source in error messages: Read input file(s) in parallel
  with parsing of the YAML document (doesn't work with YAML merge/include). Maybe
  decorate strings with lineno/charno and if the YAML module fails we catch the
  error and remove the decoration from the error message
